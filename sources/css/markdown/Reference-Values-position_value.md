`<position>` CSS type
=====================

Baseline

Widely available

This feature is well established and works across many devices and browser versions. It’s been available across browsers since July 2015.

The **`<position>`** [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
 [data type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/Data_types)
 denotes a two-dimensional coordinate used to set a location relative to an element box. It is used in the [`background-position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/background-position)
, [`object-position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/object-position)
, [`mask-position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/mask-position)
 [`offset-position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/offset-position)
, [`offset-anchor`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/offset-anchor)
 and [`transform-origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/transform-origin)
 properties.

**Note:** The final position described by the `<position>` value does not need to be inside the element's box.

[Syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/position_value#syntax)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Grid showing placement of various values. 0 0 is the top left corner. The four values, right, right center, center left 100%, and top 50% left 100%, are all equivalent, being on the right edge in the middle vertically. The two values, top 75px left 100px and left 100px top 75px, are the same. Bottom left 25% is the same as top 100% left 25%.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/position_value/position_type.png)

The `<position>` data type is specified with one or two keywords, with optional offsets.

The keyword values are `center`, `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`. Each keyword represents either an edge of the element's box or the center line between two edges. Depending on the context, `center` represents either the center between the left and right edges, or the center between the top and bottom edges.

If specified, an offset can be either a relative [`<percentage>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/percentage)
 value or an absolute [`<length>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/length)
 value. Positive values are offset towards the right or the bottom, whichever is appropriate. Negative values are offset in the opposite directions.

If only a single offset value is specified, it defines the x-coordinate, with the value for the other axis defaulting to `center`.

**Note:** The [`background-position`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/background-position)
 property also accepts a three-value syntax. This is not allowed in other properties that use `<position>`.

[Interpolation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/position_value#interpolation)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When animated, a point's abscissa and ordinate values are interpolated independently. However, because the speed of the interpolation is determined by a single [easing function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Values/easing-function)
 for both coordinates, the point will move in a straight line.
