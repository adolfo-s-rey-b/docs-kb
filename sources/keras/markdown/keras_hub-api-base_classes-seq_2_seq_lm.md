Seq2SeqLM

### `Seq2SeqLM` class

Copied!

`keras_hub.models.Seq2SeqLM()`

Base class for sequence to sequence language modeling tasks.

`Seq2SeqLM` tasks wrap a [`keras_hub.models.Backbone`](https://keras.io/keras_hub/api/base_classes/backbone#backbone-class)
 and a [`keras_hub.models.Preprocessor`](https://keras.io/keras_hub/api/base_classes/preprocessor#preprocessor-class)
 to create a model that can be used for generation and generative fine-tuning, when generation is conditioned on additional input sequence in a sequence-to-sequence setting.

`Seq2SeqLM` tasks provide an additional, high-level `generate()` function which can be used to auto-regressively sample an output sequence token by token. The `compile()` method of `Seq2SeqLM` classes contains an additional `sampler` argument, which can be used to pass a [`keras_hub.samplers.Sampler`](https://keras.io/keras_hub/api/samplers/samplers#sampler-class)
 to control how the predicted distribution will be sampled.

When calling `fit()`, each input should contain an input and output sequence. The model will be trained to predict the output sequence token-by-token using a causal mask, similar to a [`keras_hub.models.CausalLM`](https://keras.io/keras_hub/api/base_classes/causal_lm#causallm-class)
 task. Unlike the `CausalLM` task, an input sequence must be passed, and can be attended to in full by all tokens in the output sequence.

All `Seq2SeqLM` tasks include a `from_preset()` constructor which can be used to load a pre-trained config and weights.

**Example**

Copied!

``# Load a Bart backbone with pre-trained weights. seq_2_seq_lm = keras_hub.models.Seq2SeqLM.from_preset(     "bart_base_en", ) seq_2_seq_lm.compile(sampler="top_k") # Generate conditioned on the `"The quick brown fox."` as an input sequence. seq_2_seq_lm.generate("The quick brown fox.", max_length=30)``

### `from_preset` method

Copied!

`Seq2SeqLM.from_preset(preset, load_weights=True, **kwargs)`

Instantiate a [`keras_hub.models.Task`](https://keras.io/keras_hub/api/base_classes/task#task-class)
 from a model preset.

A preset is a directory of configs, weights and other file assets used to save and load a pre-trained model. The `preset` can be passed as one of:

1.  a built-in preset identifier like `'bert_base_en'`
2.  a Kaggle Models handle like `'kaggle://user/bert/keras/bert_base_en'`
3.  a Hugging Face handle like `'hf://user/bert_base_en'`
4.  a path to a local preset directory like `'./bert_base_en'`

For any `Task` subclass, you can run `cls.presets.keys()` to list all built-in presets available on the class.

This constructor can be called in one of two ways. Either from a task specific base class like `keras_hub.models.CausalLM.from_preset()`, or from a model class like `keras_hub.models.BertTextClassifier.from_preset()`. If calling from the a base class, the subclass of the returning object will be inferred from the config in the preset directory.

**Arguments**

*   **preset**: string. A built-in preset identifier, a Kaggle Models handle, a Hugging Face handle, or a path to a local directory.
*   **load\_weights**: bool. If `True`, saved weights will be loaded into the model architecture. If `False`, all weights will be randomly initialized.

**Examples**

`# Load a Gemma generative task. causal_lm = keras_hub.models.CausalLM.from_preset(     "gemma_2b_en", )  # Load a Bert classification task. model = keras_hub.models.TextClassifier.from_preset(     "bert_base_en",     num_classes=2, )`

### `compile` method

Copied!

`Seq2SeqLM.compile(     optimizer="auto", loss="auto", weighted_metrics="auto", sampler="top_k", **kwargs )`

Configures the `CausalLM` task for training and generation.

The `CausalLM` task extends the default compilation signature of [`keras.Model.compile`](https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis#compile-method)
 with defaults for `optimizer`, `loss`, and `weighted_metrics`. To override these defaults, pass any value to these arguments during compilation.

The `CausalLM` task adds a new `sampler` to `compile`, which can be used to control the sampling strategy used with the `generate` function.

Note that because training inputs include padded tokens which are excluded from the loss, it is almost always a good idea to compile with `weighted_metrics` and not `metrics`.

**Arguments**

*   **optimizer**: `"auto"`, an optimizer name, or a `keras.Optimizer` instance. Defaults to `"auto"`, which uses the default optimizer for the given model and task. See [`keras.Model.compile`](https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis#compile-method)
     and `keras.optimizers` for more info on possible `optimizer` values.
*   **loss**: `"auto"`, a loss name, or a [`keras.losses.Loss`](https://keras.io/api/losses#loss-class)
     instance. Defaults to `"auto"`, where a [`keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy`](https://keras.io/api/losses/probabilistic_losses#sparsecategoricalcrossentropy-class)
     loss will be applied for the token classification `CausalLM` task. See [`keras.Model.compile`](https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis#compile-method)
     and `keras.losses` for more info on possible `loss` values.
*   **weighted\_metrics**: `"auto"`, or a list of metrics to be evaluated by the model during training and testing. Defaults to `"auto"`, where a [`keras.metrics.SparseCategoricalAccuracy`](https://keras.io/api/metrics/accuracy_metrics#sparsecategoricalaccuracy-class)
     will be applied to track the accuracy of the model at guessing masked token values. See [`keras.Model.compile`](https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis#compile-method)
     and `keras.metrics` for more info on possible `weighted_metrics` values.
*   **sampler**: A sampler name, or a [`keras_hub.samplers.Sampler`](https://keras.io/keras_hub/api/samplers/samplers#sampler-class)
     instance. Configures the sampling method used during `generate()` calls. See `keras_hub.samplers` for a full list of built-in sampling strategies.
*   **\*\*kwargs**: See [`keras.Model.compile`](https://keras.io/api/models/model_training_apis#compile-method)
     for a full list of arguments supported by the compile method.

### `generate` method

Copied!

`Seq2SeqLM.generate(     inputs, max_length=None, stop_token_ids="auto", strip_prompt=False )`

Generate text given prompt `inputs`.

This method generates text based on given `inputs`. The sampling method used for generation can be set via the `compile()` method.

If `inputs` are a [`tf.data.Dataset`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset)
, outputs will be generated "batch-by-batch" and concatenated. Otherwise, all inputs will be handled as a single batch.

If a `preprocessor` is attached to the model, `inputs` will be preprocessed inside the `generate()` function and should match the structure expected by the `preprocessor` layer (usually raw strings). If a `preprocessor` is not attached, inputs should match the structure expected by the `backbone`. See the example usage above for a demonstration of each.

**Arguments**

*   **inputs**: python data, tensor data, or a [`tf.data.Dataset`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/data/Dataset)
    . If a `preprocessor` is attached to the model, `inputs` should match the structure expected by the `preprocessor` layer. If a `preprocessor` is not attached, `inputs` should match the structure expected the `backbone` model.
*   **max\_length**: Optional. int. The max length of the generated sequence. Will default to the max configured `sequence_length` of the `preprocessor`. If `preprocessor` is `None`, `inputs` should be should be padded to the desired maximum length and this argument will be ignored.
*   **stop\_token\_ids**: Optional. `None`, "auto", or tuple of token ids. Defaults to "auto" which uses the `preprocessor.tokenizer.end_token_id`. Not specifying a processor will produce an error. None stops generation after generating `max_length` tokens. You may also specify a list of token id's the model should stop on. Note that sequences of tokens will each be interpreted as a stop token, multi-token stop sequences are not supported.
*   **strip\_prompt**: Optional. By default, generate() returns the full prompt followed by its completion generated by the model. If this option is set to True, only the newly generated text is returned.

* * *

### `save_to_preset` method

Copied!

`Seq2SeqLM.save_to_preset(preset_dir, max_shard_size=10)`

Save task to a preset directory.

**Arguments**

*   **preset\_dir**: The path to the local model preset directory.
*   **max\_shard\_size**: `int` or `float`. Maximum size in GB for each sharded file. If `None`, no sharding will be done. Defaults to `10`.
